I've made another syntax highlighting for Notepad++ from scratch.
It looks almost like original NP++ highlighting.
As compared with another highlighting it hasn't bug with escaping symbols, and has all predefined constants & operators.

![SourcePawn syntax highlighting for Notepad++](https://forums.alliedmods.net/attachment.php?attachmentid=112215&d=1353168310)

Installing:
Notepad++ -> Language -> Define your language... -> Import and restart Notepad++.

Version: 2.0

ChangeLog:
2.0
-- Added all predefined constants with Turquoise color(the same as in standard sourcepawn highlighting)
-- Added support separating big numbers with underscore: new z = 1_000_000
1.0 - 11 views

P.S: As you can see in preview, last number in color array isn't looks correctly. It will be fixed in new revisions of Notepad++.
